# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-and-Classification-Using-MRI-and-CT-Imaging
Building a deep learning pipeline to identify and classify brain cancers using CT and MRI scans.  Conducting a comparative analysis of leading segmentation (nnU-Net++, DeepLabV3+) and classification (EfficientNetB3, ConvNeXt) models using both MRI and CT data for improved tumor detection and reliability.
